# MAS Chess
Multi-Agent Chess is a system where each piece is an agent and has an influence
on decision making. The context of the classic chess game does not need such
a system. However, it is an exciting platform for MAS. The game context has
two groups with conflicting aims, and each group respectively has different roles
inside. So the chess game allows building a complex multi-agent system with
various interaction paradigms.
